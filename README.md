# K8S-VAGRANT

A configurable, flexible, and consistent local Kubernetes cluster (or clusters) with support for most things that you would expect in a cluster such as `LoadBalancer` and persistent storage out of the box.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) to spin up a local Kuberentes cluster.  It then installs [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) for a local LoadBalancer and [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io) for persistent volumes.  It exposes several of the more common things one might like to configure through the `settings.yaml` file such as Kubernetes version and the configuration of the virtual machines.

### KISS

This project is meant to follow the **K**eep **I**t **S**imple **S**tupid philosophy.  I want the project to be organized in a way and function in a way that it's dead easy for people to use and modify it in a way that works best for them.

This means I will do my best to ensure well commented code, no overly convoluted code, and no strange dependencies or libraries.

**Why did I make this**:
* I needed a local Kubernetes cluster running on Virtual Machines instead of within containers because I needed `open-iscsi` and mount propagation which doesn't work properly within containers
* I wanted something simple that I understood instead of having to learn another tool exclusively for local development, and then figure out how to translate that to my homelab cluster.  Using Vagrant it's simply Virtual Machines.

**What about Minikube, KiND, etc.**

They're great, and may be the right fit for your needs.  I have used them and they work great, they just weren't what I was looking for.  Also, as mentioned earlier, I didn't want to learn another tool.

## Built With

[![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-%23326ce5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)](https://kubernetes.io/)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole point of the project is to spin up a Kubernetes cluster.

[![Vagrant](https://img.shields.io/badge/vagrant-%231563FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vagrant&logoColor=white)](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to provision the virtual machines using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

[![Shell Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell_script-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes heavy use of bash to provision the Virtual Machines after they are created.

### Cluster Specifics

The cluster is built using `kubeadm`, using containerd as a CRI, and Calico for pod networking.  It then adds the following additional software if configured to do so.

[metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metallb is optionally installed to provide a local load balancer into the cluster. 

[Longhorn](https://longhorn.io)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longhorn is optionally installed to provide persistent volumes with support for ReadWriteMany.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project requires only that you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed on your machine, and have enough resources available to run your configured number of machines with the amount of allocated resources.

With the default configuration it builds **1 master node and 1 worker** node each with **2Gb of RAM** and **2 cores** which is the suggested minimum from the Kubernetes project.

#### Software

Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) from their website, Chocolatey on Windows, from your package manager on Linux, or with Brew on Mac.

**Windows**
```
choco install virtualbox
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
```
apt install virtualbox
```

**Mac**
```
brew install virtualbox
```

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) using Chocolatey on Windows, from your package manager on Linux, or with Brew on Mac.

**Windows**
```powershell
choco install vagrant
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
```bash
apt install vagrant
```

**Mac**
```bash
brew install vagrant
```

## Usage

### Building your local cluster.

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danhenrydev/k8s-vagrant.git
   ```
2. Modify the configuration file at `cluster-settings.yaml` to your liking.  It comes with sane defaults.
  
3. Change into the directory and run `vagrant up`
   ```bash
   cd k8s-vagrant
   vagrant up
   ```
4. Copy the kubectl config from `generated/config` into your local `.kube` or set the environment variable to access the cluster from your local machine.
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.kube
   cp generated/config ~/.kube/config
   kubectl get nodes

   ### OR ###

   KUBECONFIG=generated/config
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

### Pausing Your Cluster
When you aren't using your cluster it makes sense to shut it down, but not destroy it as it can take a significant amount of time to rebuild in the future.  Fortunately Vagrant gives us this option.

**Pause your cluster**
```
cd k8s-vagrant
vagrant suspend
```

**Resume your cluster**
```
cd k8s-vagrant
vagrant resume
```

### Destroying your cluster
When you're finished with your cluster, or you've broken it.  You can destroy your cluster to re-initialize it for a fresh start.

```
cd k8s-vagrant
vagrant destroy
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Future Changes

Although the project seems to be working well for me as is, there are some things that I would like to add in the future that I haven't gotten around to yet.  Here's what I've thought about, in no specific order.

- [ ] Add a Traefik Ingress option
- [ ] Add support for VmWare Workstation
- [ ] Add support for QEMU
- [x] ~~Pretty up the bash scripts and output~~
- [ ] Generate a file at the end with relevant information
- [ ] Declutter the Vagrantfile
- [ ] Settings sanity check before running vagrantfile
